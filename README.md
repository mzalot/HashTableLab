# HashTableLab
x % n where n is a large prime number would make a better hash function becuase it would produce a unique number and the one with many factors could possibly not create a unique number. 
Ex: 1000%120 = 40, 1000%320= 40, 1000%97=30
Challenge Two
Char values summed % 599 would not make a good hash function for strings becuase some of the values could end up being the same int value.
